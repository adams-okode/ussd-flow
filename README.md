```bash

pip install ussdflow

```

## Getting Started

Hereâ€™s a quick example to get you started with UssdFlow:

```python
from ussdflow.ussd_lib.cache import CacheManager
from ussdflow.ussd_lib.models import IngressData
from ussdflow.ussd_lib.router import USSDService
# Initialize the cache manager

cache_manager = CacheManager(cache_type="redis", host="localhost", port=6379)

# Initialize the USSD service

ussd_service = USSDService(
    menu_file_path="path/to/your/menu.json",
    cache_manager=cache_manager
)

# Sample USSD request

request = IngressData(
    session_id="1234",
    service_code="*123#",
    phone_number="254712345678",
    text=""
)

# Process the request

response = ussd_service.ingress(request)
print(response)
```
